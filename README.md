## Installation

 There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose Sales Analysis dataset.

As a technology fan, it would be quite interesting to apply data analysis skills here.

My key interests would be:

* What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
* What city sold the most product?
* What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?

## File Descriptions

* The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.
* The dataset

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the [here](https://medium.com/@essamedo11/sales-analysis-the-tech-city-53e3b5b04de7)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

 The dataset is not so big so the data and code can be used for practice feel free to use it for training .


```python
